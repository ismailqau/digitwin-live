## Introduction

The Real-Time Conversational Clone System enables users to engage in natural voice conversations with their AI-powered digital twin. The system captures user speech, retrieves relevant information from a personalized knowledge base using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), generates contextually accurate responses, synthesizes audio in the user's cloned voice, and displays synchronized lip-sync videoâ€”all within a 2-second end-to-end latency target.
